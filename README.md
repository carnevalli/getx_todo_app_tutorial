With this project you will learn how to:

1. Create and set up a Flutter project environment to work with Get package;
2. Draw two screens using Flutter standard widgets;
3. Navigate between screens using Get navigation features;
3. Manage the state of the application using the simplicity of the GetXController;
4. Make the UI reactive in a very efficient way, rebuilding only the necessary widgets and not the entire screen;
5. Create and manage snackbars with just one line of code with Get built-in functions;
6. Implement a undo function triggered by a button inside the snackbar;
7. Use a GetX worker to listen to state changes;
8. Store the to-do list inside non-volatile memory, keeping the data available even if the app is closed.
